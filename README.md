# Project Title

Learning Log

## Description

A user-based website to log entries containing items you learned about the topics you're studying.
Built using Python's Django web framework and uploaded to Platform.sh (temporarily). Can be hosted
locally via a virtual environment.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Django

### Installing

* Download here from GitHub.

### Executing program

The best way to view this project is via a virtual environment and local hosting.
It will require the installation of Django and running a local server in a terminal
session's virtual environment. Navigate to the learning_log folder and execute:
```
python -m venv ll_env
source ll_env/bin/activate
```
This brings you to the virtual environment. While in the virtual environment, install Django:
```
pip install django
```
and run the server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
The webpage should be visible on the URL HTTP://localhost:8000/
You should be able to register and explore the page hosted on your network.
